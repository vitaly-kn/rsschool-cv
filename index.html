            "The experimental investigation by which Ampere established the law
            of the mechanical action between electric currents is one of the
            most brilliant achievements in science. The whole theory and
            experiment, seems as if it had leaped, full grown and full armed,
            from the brain of the “Newton of Electricity”. It is perfect in
            form, and unassailable in accuracy, and it is summed up in a formula
            from which all the phenomena may be deduced, and which must always
            remain the cardinal formula of electro-dynamics."
